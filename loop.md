# Loops

Most of the activities we do in life are full of repetitions. Imagine if I ask you to print out from 0 to 100 using console.log(). To implement this simple task it may take you 2 to 5 minutes, such kind of tedious and repetitive task can be carried out using loop.

In programming languages to carry out repetitive task we use different kinds of loops. The following examples are the commonly used loops in JavaScript and other programming languages.

# for Loop
consist 3 parts
 - an integer value 
 - a conditional statement
 - an operator to modify(change) the integer value after the instructions inside of the loop are completed.

```js
// For loop structure
for(initialization, condition, increment/decrement){
  // code goes here
}
```

```js
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
```

```js
for(let i = 5; i >= 0; i--){
  console.log(i)
}

// 5 4 3 2 1 0
```

```js
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  console.log(`${i} * ${i} = ${i * i}`)
}
```
out put
```sh
0 * 0 = 0
1 * 1 = 1
2 * 2 = 4
3 * 3 = 9
4 * 4 = 16
5 * 5 = 25
```

```js
const countries = ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Iceland']
const newArr = [ ]
for(let i = 0; i < countries.length; i++){
  newArr.push(countries[i].toUpperCase())
}

// ["FINLAND", "SWEDEN", "DENMARK", "NORWAY", "ICELAND"]
```

Adding all elements in the array

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let sum = 0
for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
  sum  = sum + numbers[i]  // can be shorten, sum += numbers[i]

}

console.log(sum)  // 15
```

Creating a new array based on the existing array

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const newArr = []
let sum = 0
for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
  newArr.push( numbers[i] ** 2)

}

console.log(newArr)  // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

```js
const countries = ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark', 'Iceland']
const newArr = []
for(let i = 0; i < countries.length; i++){
  newArr.push(countries[i].toUpperCase())
}

console.log(newArr)  // ["FINLAND", "SWEDEN", "NORWAY", "DENMARK", "ICELAND"]
```

# while loop

The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and you want to continue looping until a certain condition is met.

![arr index](./img/Screenshot%202025-01-24%20171430.png)

```js
let i = 0
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log(i)
  i++
}

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
```

# do while loop

The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is false on the first check.


![arr index](./img/Screenshot%202025-01-24%20171519.png)

```js
let i = 0
do {
  console.log(i)
  i++
} while (i <= 5)

// 0 1 2 3 4 5
```

# for of loop

We use for of loop for arrays. It is very hand way to iterate through an array if we are not interested in the index of each element in the array.

```js
for (const element of arr) {
  // code goes here
}
```

```js

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for (const num of numbers) {
  console.log(num)
}

// 1 2 3 4 5

// >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

for (const num of numbers) {
  console.log(num * num)
}

// 1 4 9 16 25

// >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

// adding all the numbers in the array
let sum = 0
for (const num of numbers) {
  sum = sum + num  
	// can be also shorten like this, sum += num
  // after this we will use the shorter synthax(+=, -=, *=, /= etc)
}
console.log(sum) // 15

```
```js

const webTechs = [
  'HTML',
  'CSS',
  'JavaScript',
  'React',
  'Redux',
  'Node',
  'MongoDB'
]

for (const tech of webTechs) {
  console.log(tech.toUpperCase())
}

// HTML  CSS  JAVASCRIPT  REACT  NODE  MONGODB

```

```js
const countries = ['Finland', 'Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark', 'Iceland']
const newArr = [  ]
for(const country of countries){
  newArr.push(country.toUpperCase(  ))
}

console.log(newArr)  // ["FINLAND", "SWEDEN", "NORWAY", "DENMARK", "ICELAND"]
```

## break

Break is used to interrupt a loop.

```js
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    break
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2
```

The above code stops if 3 found in the iteration process.

## continue

We use the keyword *continue* to skip a certain iterations. 

```js
for(let i = 0; i <= 5; i++){
  if(i == 3){
    continue
  }
  console.log(i)
}

// 0 1 2 4 5
```
